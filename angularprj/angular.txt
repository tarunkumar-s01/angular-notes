to run command:
         npx ng serve or npx ng s


angular:
      - it is js framework
      - it provide design and development platform or creatin single page application
      -develped by google
      - latest version is 18
      - angular is developed and maintained by google
      - it is updated every 6 months
      - it is slower than react js


s/w needed
- node js - to know the version (node -v)
- ts - to know the version (tsc -v)
- angular - to know the version (ng -version)

to install angular :
- npm i -g @angular/cli

 create new angular app:
- ng new projectname


how to create crea angular prj step by step
     -step1 : ng new projectname
     -step2 : cd projectname
     -step3 : ng serve or ng s
     -step4 : go to browser and write localhost:4200


-angular work on component
   - component : - it is a partial part of angular project
                 - it contain code for angular project
                 - it can be any part of project, which we can reuse multiple time

   - in angular root component name is {app}


how to create component in angular
      - ng generate component componentname (or) ng g c componentname

when we create component in angular it generate 4 files
html,css,ts,spec.ts


how to get op of individual component
-go to component ts file and copy its selector name and write as tag where you want


*databinding : getting or accessing data from one file to another file in same component
1. interpolation {{}} : in send data from ts file => html file
2. property binding[] : in this we set attribute(property) values ts=>html 
3. event binding () : in this we send data from html file to ts file
4. two-way binding [()] : in this we can send data from ts <=> html
                          - to perform two-way databinding we have ngmodel directory but ngmodel directory is not a part of core angular module it is a part of formsModule , for this first we to import formsModule in component.ts file import array  


Task 1 : create comp with toggleimgs in which on click have to toggle images
Task 2 : toggleimgs with four buttons 


*directive in angular 
-it is use to change appearance and behavior as well as perform DOM manipulation in angular

there are 3 types of directive
1. Structural directive : it is use to perform dom manipulation in angular 
                          - Structural directive denoted by *
                          - Structural directives are *ngIf , *ngFor , *ngSwitchCase
                          - we can apply one directive at a time to single element
                          - it is part of common module for this first we have to import common in component.  
        -ng template : display out on the basis of condition
2. attribute directive : it is use to change appearance and behavior of DOM 
        -ngStyle : it is use to apply style property on the basis of condition
        -ngclass : it is use to apply css class on the basis of condition
        -ngModel : it is use to perform two - way binding

3.custom directive:the directive created by developer
                   =>ng g directive directivename


*Component interaction:

accessing data from parent component to child component
-Input() decorator:it is use to send data from parent componentto child component
-Output() decorator:it is use to send data from child component to parent component.



*Pipes:
-------

-it is use to transform property value without changing its original value.
-it is denoted by | sign
-There are three types of pipes in angular:
        1.inbuilt pipes  : pipe created by developer
        2. custom pipes : pipe create by developer for particular use
        3. thirdparty pipes : pipes already developed by third party vendor , first we have to install it and then use it.


1.inbuilt pipe:
-string pipe
-json pipe
-number pipe
-currency pipe
-date pipe

2.Custome pipe:

*How to create custome pipe
->ng generate pipe pipename
->ng generate pipe shared/customepipe/cube


*How to install bootstrap in angular
step1:npm i bootstrap

step2:go to angular.json file and in its style array import its path
"./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
step3:restart angular project



*Routing in Angular:
-navigation of component
-to component output by using routing or navigating component by using routing in angular for it  we write code in 
 app.routes.ts file.
 -in angular all routing component will display its output bellow router-outlet
 -There are  types of routing:
 1.naming routing:
 2.default routing:
 3.re-direct routing:
 4.parameterize routing:
 5.child routing:
 6.wild-card routing:




_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 *How to navigate in angular 
 -to perform navigation we have to use routerlink property with anchor tag, but first 
   we have to import Routerlink in component ts file from "@angular/router" library.


   *Angular forms
   ---------------
   -There are two types of forms
   1.UTDF(User Template Driven form):
        -when we have create simple form validation in that case we ue it.
        -to perform validation we have to use ngModel directory with input element
        -in this ngForm directory will hold data of all input element in it.

   2.RTF(reactive Template form):
        -when we have to write complex logic to perform form validation in that case we use it.
        -to use rtf validation first we have to import ReactieveFormmodule from formsModule in component
        -In rtf we write form validation code in ts file
        -in this we use  mainly two classes 1.FormGroup 2.FormControl.
          -1.FormGroup:it will hold information of all input element.
          -2.FormControl:it willl hold information of individual input element.

step1:"json-server"cd/src/shared/database && json-server -watach -p 8888 db.json",
step2:"start-dev":"concurrently \"ng serve\" \"npm run json-server\"", 
      - paste in package.json into scripts
step3 terminate all server and terminal
step4: npm run start-dev


guard : in ng guard is



how to generate guard
- ng g guard guardname
- ng g guard shared/custguard/auth
